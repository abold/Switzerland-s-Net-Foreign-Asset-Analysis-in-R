1. Decomposing Changes in Net Foreign Assets (NFA)
We begin by decomposing the change in Switzerland’s NFA position into two main components:
ΔNFAₜ = CAₜ + VEₜ
Where:
	ΔNFAₜ : Change in net foreign assets-  over the period (2000–2024)
	CAₜ:  Current account balance
	VEₜ:  Valuation effects (including capital gains/losses and exchange rate impacts)
This decomposition allows us to ask: Is Switzerland’s NFA improving due to persistent current account surpluses, or is it earning superior returns on its external assets?
